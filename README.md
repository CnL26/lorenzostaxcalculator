# lorenzostaxcalculator 
The very first program I created. I wasnt thinking really about it th…

…e idea just came suddenly. This was also coded with Pydroid3. To use: When prompted, enter an amount i.e.:.99,5.99,etc..Then when prompted you can either enter y to keep adding or return for total. Before grand total you will be asked to enter your states decimal tax, i.e.: 0.07,0.08,etc...Then just hit return it will give grand total and a nice exit messagegit status! I hope ot can inspire some one. Lastly all the versions are bare-basic up until version 30.
